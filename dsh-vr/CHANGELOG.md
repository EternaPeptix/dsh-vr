# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Expansion approval no longer qualifies an engagement that was not qualified.
- Reopening a closed thread resets stage to assessed and clears revalidation.
- CRLF normalised at parse entry.
- Enrichment writes telemetry only when enabled.
- Telemetry rotation keeps two generations instead of overwriting.
- Exclude rules match path segments, not substrings.
- Scan patterns bounded; nested quantifiers refused.
- writeAtomic fsyncs the file and directory.
- Completion records who claimed and who decided; self-certification is surfaced.
- Guard refusal wording no longer overclaims.
- Licence, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, test script; engagement patch untracked.
- Every state-file section is fenced on write, so captured content cannot forge a heading.
- The guard resolves the network client in any token position, not just the first.
- A fence whose info string is anything other than `[a-z]*` unwraps on read instead of nesting again.
- Unknown frontmatter keys are preserved across rewrites instead of being deleted.
- A cited artifact stored without a hash is reported as a gate caveat instead of being skipped.
- `concurrency` in ENGAGEMENT.md is the ceiling actually applied when opening threads.
